This repo holds both the smart contracts used for front end and back end code for MauiDAO. 

It is a fork of KLIMA DAO site and klima DAO solidity contracts (which are forks of OlympusDAO). As such many of the names have not been changed from KLIMA to MAUI.

# Summary
This repo contains 3 packages: `@klimadao/site`, `@klimadao/app` and `@klimadao/lib`.

`@klimadao/site` -> klimadao.finance homepage. In the future, we can add the docs and blog as well.

`@klimadao/app` -> dapp.klimadao.finance app, a standalone single-page-app. Should be exportable as a static site for deployment on IPFS.

`@klimadao/lib` -> A shared component and theme library. For now, just a set of resources shared by the above two apps. In the future, this can be extended and published on NPM as a component library for use in other community projects.

# Getting Started
## Requirements
Take note, this repo utilizes newer features from Node, NPM and the upcoming release of Typescript.

- Node >= v16.x
- NPM >= v8.x (necessary for NPM Workspaces)
- Typescript >= 4.5.0-beta (better ESModules support) `npm install -g typescript@4.5.0-beta`
- VSCode [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- VSCode [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Install dependencies
From the `klimadao/` root folder, *not* from individual packages:
`npm install`

## Develop
A set of NPM Workspace commands are provided, and can be run from the root folder.

`npm run dev-site`: run the website on localhost:3000

`npm run dev-app`: run the app on localhost:3001

`npm run dev-lib`: Watch for changes in `@klimadao/lib` and recompile on save. Alternatively, run `npm run build-lib` to compile once (this is already done automatically for the above two commands).

# Contribution Guide
Coming Soon.
The GitHub Issues board should be our source-of-truth and where most engineering discussion takes place.
